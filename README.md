## What is Sentinel Gateway?

Sentinel Gateway is an intelligent API control plane that wraps your microservices in a closed-loop intelligence layer. Instead of passively forwarding traffic, it continuously monitors every service, detects emerging anomalies before they cascade, shapes load in real time, and produces a full, reversible audit trail of every autonomous decision it makes.

The result: **incidents are contained in milliseconds, not minutes — and your on-call engineer reads a post-incident report, not a pager alert.**

## The Four-Capability Loop

```
SENSE ──► DECIDE ──► ACT ──► EXPLAIN
  ▲                              │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
         closed-loop feedback
```

| Phase | What happens | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| **Sense** | Bayesian anomaly detection on p99, error rate, and RPS deltas | < 40 ms |
| **Decide** | Policy engine weighs circuit-breaker vs. adaptive shedding vs. backpressure | < 200 ms |
| **Act** | Circuit opens, traffic sheds, or retry buffers engage — zero human input | < 300 ms |
| **Explain** | Full weighted-reasoning trace logged; operator can approve or one-click rollback | instant |

---

## Live Stats (real-time on the dashboard)

| Metric | Typical value | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Requests / sec | ~131k | Total inbound RPS across all services |
| Global p99 | ~97 ms | 99th-percentile end-to-end latency |
| Error rate | ~1.66% | End-user visible errors (circuit-open traffic excluded) |
| Decision confidence | 96% | SentinelBrain-v3 model certainty on last autonomous action |
| Requests protected | 312k+ | Requests shielded from cascading failures since last incident |

## Application Screens

| Route | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | **Overview** | Cinematic 3D landing page — glass prism + particle stream hero, live stat bar, feature grid, and the closed-loop explainer. |
| `/command-center` | **Command Center** | Real-time KPI cards with sparklines, interactive service topology map, node inspector with Apply Mitigation / Snooze / Reset, and a live anomaly feed. |
| `/flow-canvas` | **Flow Canvas** | Visual traffic-shaping policy editor. Tune capacity budgets per service, create new policies, and deploy changes — all persisted to Neon Postgres. |

## Production-Grade Backend

This is not a demo with localStorage. Every operator action is durable.

### Database — Neon Postgres (9 tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification` | Better Auth — operator identity and sessions |
| `service_nodes` | Persistent health and circuit state for each gateway node |
| `shaping_policies` | Durable traffic-shaping policy definitions |
| `decisions` | AI-generated gateway decisions with outcomes |
| `decision_steps` | Per-step reasoning trace for the explainer UI |
| `audit_log` | Tamper-evident log of every sentinel and operator action |

All 9 tables were provisioned directly via the Neon MCP. The schema is defined in `lib/db/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM with snake_case column mappings that match the Neon database exactly.

### Authentication — Better Auth

- Email + password authentication for operators
- Session cookies with `sameSite: none` + `secure: true` for cross-origin iframe compatibility (v0 preview)
- Full `trustedOrigins` cascade: local dev → Vercel preview → Vercel production
- All inner routes (`/command-center`, `/flow-canvas`, `/decisions`) redirect unauthenticated visitors to `/sign-in`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable required (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)

### Server Actions (Zod-validated, session-scoped)

```
app/actions/
  policies.ts    — getPolicies, createPolicy, updatePolicy, deletePolicy
  decisions.ts   — getDecisions, applyDecisionAction (approve / rollback)
  nodes.ts       — applyNodeAction (mitigate / snooze / reset)
  audit.ts       — getAuditLog (JSON or CSV export)
```

Every action calls `getUserId()` which validates the Better Auth session before touching the database. There is no RLS on Neon — every query is explicitly scoped by `userId`.

### API Routes (all Neon-backed)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/auth/[...all]` | GET, POST | Better Auth catch-all handler |
| `/api/telemetry/stream` | GET SSE | Server-side tick loop merging DB node health into the live stream |
| `/api/telemetry/snapshot` | GET | Single frozen snapshot for SSR hydration |
| `/api/nodes` | GET | Current node list from Neon |
| `/api/nodes/[id]/action` | POST | Persist operator mitigation action to DB |
| `/api/policies` | GET, POST | List and create shaping policies |
| `/api/policies/[id]` | PATCH, DELETE | Update or remove a policy |
| `/api/decisions` | GET | Decision list with full step traces joined from `decision_steps` |
| `/api/decisions/[id]/action` | POST | Approve or roll back a decision |
| `/api/audit` | GET | Full audit log — JSON or `Accept: text/csv` for file download |

## Real-Time Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sim as Sim Engine (1.5 s tick)
    participant Hook as useLiveWithDb()
    participant SSE as /api/telemetry/stream
    participant DB as Neon Postgres
    participant UI as Browser Components

    Note over Sim: tick-0 frozen snapshot → SSR hydration
    Sim->>Hook: tick fires (client)
    Hook->>SSE: EventSource connection
    SSE->>DB: SELECT node health + circuit state
    DB-->>SSE: durable overrides (health, circuit, p99, error_rate)
    SSE-->>Hook: SSE event — merged JSON snapshot
    Hook->>Hook: overlay DB state over sim data
    Hook->>UI: re-render sparklines, feeds, topology map
```

The client simulation engine (`lib/live-store.ts`) runs a continuous 1.5 s tick for animated metrics. `useLiveWithDb()` subscribes to the server-sent event stream and overlays real DB node health and circuit state on top of the simulation, ensuring the UI always reflects persisted gateway state while maintaining smooth animations.

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Why a client simulation engine alongside a real DB?**
The DB stores authoritative state (circuit open/closed, health, policies). The simulation adds animated telemetry (RPS fluctuations, sparklines, p99 jitter) so the UI feels alive. They are deliberately separate: the DB drives correctness, the simulation drives aesthetics. `useLiveWithDb()` merges them — DB fields win on every key collision.

**Why no RLS on Neon?**
Better Auth uses a `pg` Pool for session management. Adding row-level security to the same Pool requires per-query `SET LOCAL role` which conflicts with connection pooling. Instead, every server action and API route calls `getUserId()` which throws `Unauthorized` if the session is missing, and all queries include an explicit `WHERE userId = ?` clause.

**Why `'use client'` is never imported from server routes**
`lib/live-store.ts` is a `'use client'` module. Previous versions of the codebase imported it in the SSE route handler and the nodes action API, causing a hard Next.js build failure. The fix was to rewrite both server routes to be fully self-contained — no live-store imports, no browser globals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) Postgres database
- A `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` — generate one with:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```

### Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<32+ character random string>
```

### Database Setup

The 9 required tables are defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`. Create them by running the following SQL against your Neon database (or use the Neon console / Neon MCP):

**Better Auth tables** (must be created first):
```sql
-- user, session, account, verification
-- Run the DDL from lib/db/schema.ts or use: npx better-auth migrate
```

**App tables** (`service_nodes`, `shaping_policies`, `decisions`, `decision_steps`, `audit_log`):
```sql
-- All DDL is in lib/db/schema.ts
-- Use drizzle-kit to push: pnpm exec drizzle-kit push
```

After pushing the schema, seed initial gateway topology:
```bash
# Optional: seed the service_nodes and shaping_policies tables
# with the 8-node topology and 5 default policies used in production.
# See lib/sentinel-data.ts for the seed values.
```

### Install and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign up for an operator account at `/sign-up`, and you are in.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
